Search for selection in MPRA data
====

Smith, McManus, and Fraser 2013 and Agoglia and Fraser 2013 both used data from
a Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) to test for selection on enhancers
and non-coding elements. In this project, I'm hoping to find similar signs of
selection in the saturation mutagenesis data from the Ahithuv lab [1].
